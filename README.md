# ECCIC256 (Pronounced "Eekick256") -- An ECDLP formal verification system

The goal of ECCIC256 is to provide a manner in which one can formally verify the security assumptions made for ECDSA algorithms such as the unfeasiblity of the discrete logarithm problem.

This package is being built in Coq. We formalize elliptic curves (ECs) over finite fields in Coq. We then provide proofs of algebraic properties ensuring the group structure. Then we outline the definition and verification of ECDLP assumptions.

This project is produced by Vasudevan Govardhanen -- A student of Manalapan High School, Manalapan, NJ.

# Formal Verification of Elliptic Curve Cryptography Security Assumptions in Coq (Elliptic Curve Cryptography with the Calculus of Inductive Constructions)

## Abstract

This repository provides a comprehensive formalization of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and its underlying security assumptions within the Coq proof assistant. The implementation encompasses a rigorous treatment of the algebraic structures underlying elliptic curves, formal verification of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) hardness assumptions, and mechanically verified proofs of security properties for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and its variants.

## Technical Overview

### Algebraic Foundations

The formalization begins with a type-theoretic representation of finite fields using dependent types to enforce value constraints. The implementation provides:

- Field operations with verified algebraic properties (commutativity, associativity, distributivity)
- Rigorous encoding of elliptic curves in both Weierstrass and Edwards forms
- Machine-checked proofs that curve points form abelian groups under the defined operations
- Formalization of isomorphisms between different curve representations

### Computational Hardness Assumptions

The ECDLP is formally defined using dependent types to capture the computational problem:

```
Definition ECDLP {p : Z} {F : FiniteField p} {E : EllipticCurve F}
                (P Q : ECPoint E) : Type :=
  {k : Z | 0 <= k < p /\ ec_mul (Pos.of_Z k) P = Q}.
```

The security assumptions are modeled via:

- Type-theoretic encodings of probabilistic polynomial-time adversaries
- Formally verified negligible functions for asymptotic security analysis
- Reduction-based security proofs connecting ECDLP to other computational hardness assumptions

### ECDSA Implementation and Verification

The formalization includes:

- Complete mechanized implementation of ECDSA key generation, signing, and verification
- Formal proofs of correctness demonstrating that signatures generated by honest parties always verify
- Security theorems establishing the unforgeability of ECDSA under the ECDLP hardness assumption
- Analysis of signature malleability including formal proofs of the low-S canonicalization

### Advanced Cryptographic Constructions

The repository extends beyond basic ECDSA to include:

- Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) with formal correctness proofs
- Constant-time implementations using Montgomery ladder with formal side-channel resistance verification
- Pre-hashed variants (ECDSA*) with rigorous security analysis
- Multi-scalar multiplication optimizations with Shamir's trick

### Side-Channel Analysis

The formalization provides a rigorous treatment of side-channel vulnerabilities:

- Type-theoretical model of timing information leakage
- Formal verification of countermeasures including scalar blinding and constant-time algorithms
- Machine-checked proofs that optimized implementations preserve the security properties of their naive counterparts

## Implementation Details

The implementation leverages Coq's powerful type system and dependent types to enforce invariants at compile time:

- Field elements are represented as `{z : Z | 0 <= z < p}`, capturing the constraint directly in the type
- Security properties are expressed using propositions in Coq's native logic
- Scalability is achieved through carefully constructed abstraction barriers
- Modular design permits verification of specific components in isolation

The mechanization employs sophisticated proof techniques:

- Induction over computational structures
- Algebraic manipulations using Coq's rewriting system
- Probabilistic reasoning using axiomatic extensions to Coq's standard library
- Parametric polymorphism to abstractly reason about arbitrary elliptic curves

## Theorems and Formal Guarantees

Key formal results established in this repository include:

1. **Group Law Correctness**: Machine-verified proofs that elliptic curve points form an abelian group under addition
2. **ECDLP Hardness Reduction**: Formal reduction from ECDLP to the general discrete logarithm problem
3. **ECDSA Correctness**: Theorem proving that valid signatures always verify under the correct public key
4. **ECDSA Unforgeability**: Security proof establishing that signature forgery is computationally infeasible under the ECDLP assumption
5. **Side-Channel Resistance**: Formal verification that constant-time implementations do not leak timing information about secret keys

## Cryptographic Parameters

The repository includes formal specifications of standardized curves:

- NIST P-256 with verified non-singularity and prime order
- Curve25519 with formal proofs of its Montgomery form properties

## Usage in Verification Scenarios

This formalization enables several critical verification tasks:

1. Formal verification of cryptographic protocol implementations against their specifications
2. Machine-checked proofs that optimized implementations maintain security properties
3. Rigorous analysis of side-channel vulnerabilities and their mitigations
4. Formal verification of the correctness of key agreement and digital signature schemes based on elliptic curves

The repository is designed for interoperability with other formal verification tools through standard interfaces and well-defined semantics.
